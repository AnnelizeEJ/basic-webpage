                    It came into being a vehicle for advocating social justice, as a space for reflection and contemplation and as an institution for challenging the distortion and half-truths which  proped up the history of Cape Town and South Africa.
                    The Distric Six foundation awas established in 1989 and in 1994 The Distric Six Museum came into being. This museum was established to commemorate and remember the Distric Six community that was scattered when the Apartheid Government declared the area a 'Whites Only' area. 
                    The Museum has expanded its work from its location in the methodist Church building at 25A Buitenkant Street into a neighbouring building building number 15 Buitenkant Street now the Distric Sic Museum Homecoming Centre is known to marry Capetonians as  sacks futeran textile and soft goods warehouse.

               <p>  Built in 1905, Cape Town’s City Hall is the first place from where Nelson Mandela spoke after his release from prison in 1990.
                    The honey-coloured City Hall in Cape Town has seen many changes in its years of standing vigil on the Grand Parade. It has seen South Africa develop into the multi-cultural melting pot that it is today, and played a very important role in that change.
                    Addressing over 10 000 jubilant people just hours after his release, Mandela famously had to borrow his wife’s reading glasses as he had left his in prison. His speech, started with the words: "Comrades and fellow South Africans, I greet you all in the name of peace, democracy and freedom. I stand here before you not as a prophet, but as a humble servant of you the people."

                        The Castle of Good Hope was not built by Jan Van Riebeeck. A four-pointed clay and timber fort was the first building to be erected in his time, and it was his suggestion that this be replaced by a more permanent structure that could withstand the elements and possible attacks. The existing stone “star fort” was built four years after Jan van Riebeeck left the Cape
                        The Castle of Good Hope was referred to as “Kui keip” (Stone Kraal) by the Khoi and sometimes “Citadel” by Dutch settlers
                        Yellow paint was originally chosen for the walls because it reduced the effects of the hot African sun
